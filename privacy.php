You may make payments through the Service to any business, merchant, or professional with a valid address.

 <br>
<b>B. Your Payee List</b> 
 <br>
You must provide sufficient information about each Payee as we may request from time to time, to properly direct a payment to that Payee and permit the Payee to identify the correct Payee Account to credit with your payment. This information may include, among other criteria, the name, address, and phone number of the Payee and your Payee Account number. You agree that we may obtain information regarding your Payee Accounts in order to facilitate proper handling and crediting of your payments, and you authorize your Payees to release such information to us. You further authorize us to confirm and standardize a payee's address at our discretion and without notice to you. You can enter your Payee Information directly through the Service. Additions, deletions, and modifications to Payee Information are entered directly on through the Service. To begin using the Service you will first need to establish at least one Payee in your Payee List.   
You may add, modify or delete Payees as necessary. It is your responsibility to manage your Payee List and maintain accurate Payee information, such as but not limited to the address to which the Payee specifies Payments are to be delivered, your account number with the Payee, the name on your account with the Payee, etc. except where the Service expressly indicates that it shall manage such Payee information, such as a Merchant’s remittance address. Payees must reside or exist within the United States of America or its territories or commonwealths. The Service provider and/or the Financial Institution reserve the right to refuse or remove a Payee for any reason. 
 <br>
<b>C. E-Bills</b> 
 <br>
E-bills is a feature of the bill pay service that enables you to receive bills electronically from participating Payees. You must be a user of Online Banking in order to receive e-Bills. 
 <br>
•	Approval of e-Bills 
Participating Payees establish their own criteria for reviewing requests to receive e-Bills and have sole discretion to accept or decline your request. We do not participate in this decision. 
 <br>
•	Accessing e-Bills from a Third Party 
In some cases, we obtain the e-Bill from the web site of the Payee. To do so, we will ask you for information needed for this purpose, such as any required password. When you provide this information, you authorize us to access the third party web site to retrieve the account information on your behalf, and you appoint us as your agent for this limited purpose. 
 <br>
•	Timely Delivery of e-Bills 
We take no responsibility if a Payee does not provide the necessary data to forward an e-Bill in a timely manner. If you do not receive a bill, it is your responsibility to contact the Payee directly. We are not responsible for any late charges or other adverse consequences. Any questions regarding your bill details should be directed to your Payee. 
 <br>
•	Stop e-Bills 
All parties have the right to cancel the service at any time. If you request that an e-Bill be discontinued, it may take up to 60 days for the Payee to receive and process the request. 
 <br>
•	Privacy 
When you establish e-Bills with a participating Payee you will provide certain information that will be forwarded onto the Payee to complete your enrollment. If you have concerns about the future use of this information you should contact your Payee directly. 
 <br>
 <b>D. Scheduling Bill Payments</b> 
 <br>
To schedule Payments, you must choose a Payee from your Payee List. You may schedule One-Time Payments and Recurring Payments to any of your Payees. It is your responsibility to cancel, skip, reschedule or revise a Scheduled Payment in accordance with the Payee’s instructions to you, or as needed to ensure sufficient available funds in the corresponding Funding Account, or under circumstances where the Payee may return the Payment to the Service provider due to any reason outside the Service provider’s or the Financial Institution’s control. The Service provider and/or the Financial Institution reserve the right to refuse or cancel a Payment for any reason. 
 <br>
The earliest possible Due Date / Deliver by Date for each Payee will be determined and presented by the Service when you schedule a Payment. The Service will not permit a Due Date / Deliver by Date earlier than the earliest possible dates presented. The Service determines this earliest possible Due Date / Deliver By Date based on the number of Business Days required to deliver a Payment to the Payee, which is primarily affected by whether or not the Payee has agreed to accept remittance of Payments electronically (typically one or two (1 or 2) Business Days) or requires Payments be delivered by check (typically four or five (4 or 5) Business Days). A Payee’s location or policies for posting and crediting payments may require additional Business Days. Payments scheduled after the Service’s Cut-Off Time shall be processed no earlier than the following Business Day. Currently, the Cut-Off Time is 4:00 p.m West African Time, but the Service provider and/or the Financial Institution may change the Cut-Off Time without prior notice. 
 
You should carefully consider factors such as the Payee’s date payment due, grace period, whether the Payee’s date payment due falls on a non-Business Day, etc., when scheduling a Payment to avoid late payments and late fees. You must allow the necessary number of Business Days prior to the Payee’s date payment due for each Payment, including each Payment of a Recurring Payment series. Some businesses take longer to post payments than others. You should consider allowing additional time for the initial Payment to a Payee through the Service in order to gauge the appropriate Pay Due Date / Deliver by Date in each case, and determine whether to allow an additional one (1) or two (2) business days to avoid incurring any late fee charged by the Merchant. It is your responsibility to schedule Payments appropriately and in accordance with the Payee’s requirements. Neither the Service provider nor the Financial Institution shall be responsible for late payments, nor reimburse you for late fees, for any Payment delivered in accordance with your instructions, or as a result of a Payee’s payment processing policies, or any other circumstance outside the Service provider’s control. 
 
Payments to Payees, businesses or individuals, outside Nigerian or its territories or commonwealths, are prohibited. 
 
E. How Bill Payments are delivered 
 
We reserve the right to select the method in which to remit funds on your behalf to your Payees. These payment methods may include, but may not be limited to, an electronic funds transfer or a paper draft payment (funds remitted to the Payee are deducted from your Payment Account when the paper draft is presented to your financial institution for payment). For Payees that are unable to receive electronic payments, we may send payments by a paper draft drawn on your Account. You agree that all paper drafts issued on your authorized instructions will be the same as if actually signed by you. 
 
We are not responsible for postal delays or processing delays by the Payees. Occasionally, a Payee chooses not to participate in the Service, or may be unable to process payments in a timely manner. In such cases, we may decline to make future payments to these Payees. 
<br> 
<b>F. Expedited Payments</b> 
 <br>
The Service will allow you to make Expedited Payments using the funds in your Funding Account for a fee. An Expedited Payment may be delivered to the Payee via electronic fund transfer (ACH Debit) or paper check mailed through an overnight service depending on the Payees capabilities. Scheduled Payments are processed as batch transactions at the end of the Business Day. Expedited Payments, depending on the time the transaction was scheduled, may be processed with the Scheduled Payments, or immediately. Next day delivery of overnight checks may depend on the time of day that the transaction is scheduled, and is not guaranteed. There is a fee for processing Expedited Payment and the fee depends on whether the transaction can be processed as an ACH Debit or as paper check mailed through overnight service. These fees are disclosed in the Expedited Payment Terms and Conditions presented at the time of setting up an Expedited Payment. 
 <br>
<b>G. Processing Your Bill Payments</b> 
 <br>
Although you may schedule bill payments by using the Service 24-hours a day, seven (7) days a week, payments will be withdrawn from your Account only on Business Days, subject to system availability. We may refuse to process your payment if sufficient funds, including funds available under any overdraft plan, are not available in your Account(s). 
 <br>
<b>H. Sufficient Funds for Payments</b> 
 <br>
You agree to transmit a payment instruction only if funds in the Payment Account will be sufficient on the Scheduled Payment Date to make the payment. If the Payment Account does not have sufficient funds (including funds available under any overdraft plan) on the Scheduled Payment Date, we may (but are not required to) debit the Payment Account for the Payment<br>
Amount; you will incur NSF fees whether the Payment Amount is or is not debited from the Payment Account. If we do not debit the payment account for the payment amount due to insufficient funds in your payment account, the payment processor may (but is not required to) fund a payment; if the processor does, the processor has certain rights to pursue you for the payment. You agree to verify whether a payment was or was not made and, if necessary, to reschedule the payment. 
<br>

(The day on which a payment instruction is entered differs from the Scheduled Payment Date.) The Service provider and/or OTECH Microfinance Bank Limited may change the Cut-Off Time without prior notice. 
 <br>
   
<b>K. Delivery</b>
 
Due to circumstances beyond the control of the Service, particularly delays in handling and posting payments by Payees or financial institutions, some transactions may take longer to be credited to your account. The Service will bear responsibility for any late payment related charges up to $50.00 should a payment post after its Due Date as long as the payment was scheduled in accordance with the guidelines described under “Bill Payment Scheduling” in this Agreement and if you meet each of the following conditions: <br>
 
1.	You must properly schedule the Scheduled Payment Date to be on or before the date the payment is due to the Payee, including any required processing time. This means that you must schedule your payments before 4:00 p.m. Nigerian time, on a Business Day at least four (4) Business Days prior to the date the payment is due to the Payee. <br>
2.	You must provide us with the correct Payee name, address, due date, account information, and the correct payment amount. <br>
3.	Your Account(s), including any overdraft plan, must contain sufficient funds to complete the payment or transfer on the Scheduled Payment Date.<br>

7.	We are not responsible for failure to deliver any payment that we have reserved the right to refuse to process as provided in this Agreement. <br>
8.	The Payee has not held or “batched” payments over several days. <br>
<b>L. Stopping or Modifying Bill Payments</b><br>
Any Payment can be modified or canceled, provided you access the Service prior to the Cut-Off Time on the Business Day that the Payment is going to be processed.  Once a check payment is in-process, it cannot be canceled through the Service.   Instead, you must contact Customer Service at 08100557064 to request a stop payment. An electronic payment cannot be canceled or stopped once it is no longer in a scheduled status. A Recurring Payment may be edited or canceled after processing for the current Payment instance is complete. 

<b>M. Stop Payment</b>
<br>
You may request to stop payment after a payment has been processed by contacting Customer Service, 08100557064. The Service’s ability to successfully stop payment depends on how the funds were remitted to the Payee and the elapsed time since the Payment was processed. The Service provider and the Financial Institution will make commercially reasonable efforts to stop payment per your request, but shall have no liability if unsuccessful. You may be charged a stop payment fee for each request. <br>
 
<b>N. Incomplete Payments</b> <br>
If we remit your payment to a Payee by mailing your Payee a draft check, and the check has not been presented for payment you may contact Customer Service, as directed in the Online/Mobile Services screens for assistance in researching your payment. <br>

<b>XI. Liability Provisions Applicable to Consumer Accounts Only </b><br>
 
The following provisions apply in the event you believe there has been an unauthorized transfer from your consumer Account. Please refer to the applicable Account Agreement for other important disclosures regarding your rights and responsibilities.<br> 
 
<b>A. Your Liability</b><br> 
 
Tell us at once if you believe your User ID and Password has been lost or stolen. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your Account plus your maximum overdraft line of credit. If you believe your User ID and Password has been lost or stolen, and you tell us within two (2) Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your User ID and Password without your permission. <br>
 
If you do not tell us within two (2) Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your User ID and Password, and we can prove that we could have stopped someone from using your User ID and Password without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.<br>
Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the statement was mailed to you or otherwise made available to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time. <br>
 
If a good reason, such as a long trip or a hospital stay, kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods.<br> 
 
<b>B. Bank Liability for Transfers</b><br> 
 
If we do not complete a transfer to or from your Account on time or in the correct amount according to our Agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages. This liability is in addition to the payment guarantee for bill payments. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:<br> 
 
i.	If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your Account to make the transfer or payment.<br> 
ii.	If the transfer or payment would go over the credit limit on your overdraft line.<br> 
iii.	If the funds in your Account are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting such transfer. <br>
iv.	If the Service, your PC, your phone or wireless device or internet connectivity is not working properly and you know about the malfunction when you start the transfer or payment. <br>
v.	If a Payee mishandles or causes delays in handling payments sent by us.<br> 
vi.	You have not provided us with the correct Payee name, address, account information, or payment amount. <br>
vii.	If circumstances beyond our control prevent the proper completion of the transaction despite reasonable precautions by us to avoid these circumstances. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, fire, flood, delay in Nigerian Mail, interruption in your electrical power or telephone, the disconnecting of your telephone line by your local telephone company or from deficiencies in your line quality, or any defect or malfunction of your PC, operating software, modem, or telephone line. <br>
viii.	If you have not properly followed the instructions for using Online/Mobile Banking.<br> 
ix.	If the account holding institution fails to timely credit an External Transfer to your External Account for reasons beyond our control. <br>
x.	If we have the right to refuse to process a payment or transfer as provided in this Agreement. <br>

If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your Account within ten (10) Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.
